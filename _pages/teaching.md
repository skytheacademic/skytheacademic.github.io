### Instructor of Record

*POL 237 - Modern Weapons and International Relations, Summer 2021/22 (Online)*

See the bottom of this page for one of my many videos for POL-237.

Anonymous reviews from students regarding my teaching:

* "Great communication and fair, clear feedback on assignments"
* "Loved this class, Prof. Kunkel was a great instructor, I especially loved the format of the class and transparency from the start about what to expect. I hope they continue to lay out and stick to a schedule in the syllabus so well, it made it very easy to succeed as a student"
* "Sky has done a great job with organizing this course. I found the videos extremely informative and easy to follow, yet also containing key information. I also appreciated that there was more than one medium to get the information from, be it audio recordings, videos (which I preferred), or the script from that week. I would hope that they continue to do everything they have already done, and that you guys give them a raise, because they deserve it"
