About
======

Hello! I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the [Gender and Security Sector](https://www.sabrinamkarim.com/gsslab) (GSS) Lab at Cornell University, and a former United States Institute of Peace (USIP) [Peace Scholar](https://www.usip.org/grants-fellowships/jennings-randolph-peace-scholarship-dissertation-program/former-peace-scholars). I obtained my Ph.D. from Purdue University in May 2024, studying international relations and political methodology. **I am on the 2024-25 academic job market!**

My research broadly focuses on the intersection of security and nonstate actors. I apply advanced methods of causal inference to uncover the effects of nonstate actors on violence, and I have experience teaching quantitative methods and causal inference to graduate students. My security research often focuses on United Nations (UN) peacekeeping and evaluating how, when, and where peacekeepers effectively protect civilians. For example, in my [job market paper](https://www.skytheacademic.com/files/who_keeps_the_peace.pdf), I develop a novel theory on the gendered effects of peacekeepers due to the impact of women peacekeepers on the UN's ability to gather intelligence, and then demonstrate those effects with the first quantitative empirical analysis on women peacekeepers. Outside of UN Peacekeeping, my research interests include other nonstate actors like Private Military and Security Contractors, such as my research on [Russia's Wagner Group](https://www.skytheacademic.com/files/violence_as_a_condition.pdf). I also use rigorous methods of qualitative research when it is more appropriate, and have conducted qualitative coding and descriptive theory building in my research on the [UN's use of Private Security Contractors](www.skytheacademic.com/files/double_delegation.pdf).

For a more detailed narrative about what, why, and how I study what I do, please see my bio [here](https://www.skytheacademic.com/bio).

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository. -->
