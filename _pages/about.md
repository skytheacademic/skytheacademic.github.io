About
======
I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate at Purdue University, studying international relations (IR) with a minor in political methodology. My research broadly focuses on the intersection of security and non-state actors. My security research often focuses on United Nations (UN) peacekeeping and evaluating how, when, and where peacekeepers effectively protect civilians. For example, my dissertation, tentatively titled, *The Local Effects of UN Peacekeeping*, examines the effects peacekeepers have on saving civilian lives and preventing violence against civilians with advanced quantitative methods at the most granular level used in the peacekeeping effectiveness literature.

My research also encompasses other non-state security actors, such as private military and security contractors (PMSCs). In my research on the UN's use of private security contractors (PSCs), for example, I first construct a novel database to expand our descriptive understanding of what we know about how the UN uses PSCs. Next, I built the concept of double delegation of authority, which borrows ideas and structures from the sociology literature on symbols, the principal-agent literature on delegation costs, and the sovereignty literature on authority.

I am always open to collaborative research projects and am currently working on several projects with other graduate students and professors. My most recent research on PMSCs focuses on non-traditional actors, such as Russia's use of the [Wagner Group](https://www.csis.org/blogs/post-soviet-post/band-brothers-wagner-group-and-russian-state), which I am working on with [Matthew Ellis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matt-ellis-7b187492/). I'm also working on a peacekeeping project with professors [Zach Warner](https://zachwarner.net/) and [Doug Atkinson](https://dougbatkinson.wordpress.com/), examining when violence fills the vacuum left when peacekeepers depart. Finally, I'm working on a research project with [Catalina Vega-Méndez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/catalina-vega-mendez-9947a01b9/), where we investigate the effects of peacekeepers as a mediating variable on the perception of migrants.

Short Biography
======
Before starting my Ph.D. program at Purdue, I received my BA from Purdue in 2019. I grew up in Indianapolis, IN, and started my undergraduate studies in 2015 in political science. I initially started grad school to advance my expertise in IR to a Master's level. However, collaborations with fellow graduate students and professors alongside rigorous training in methodology fostered an affinity for all things research, leading me to pursue academia as a career. I am a first-gen queer scholar seeking to improve the lives and experiences of those marginalized by academia and the broader world, especially minority and first-gen grad students who often face barriers invisible to others.

If you are interested in talking to me, please feel free to contact me on any of the platforms listed on the left side of this page or schedule a meeting with me [here](https://koalendar.com/e/meet-with-sky/).

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository. -->
